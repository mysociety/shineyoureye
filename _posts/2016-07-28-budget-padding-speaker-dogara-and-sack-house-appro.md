There seems to be no end to the controversy surrounding the recent sack of Chairman of Appropriation Committee in the House of Representatives, Hon. Abdul Mumuni Jibrin.

This is because he has said that his refusal to support immunity for presiding officers as well refusal to approve the ₦40 billion for principal officers out of N100 billion approved for members of the House for constituency projects led to his removal.

Mr. Jibrin according to media reports said Speaker Dogara had repeatedly victimized him for being an independent voice in the lower chamber, saying he would work to ensure that the Speaker either resigns or is disgraced from office.

To achieve his aim, Mr. Jibrin said he would reveal to Nigerians all the corrupt practices involving Speaker Dogara, which he said were well documented.

In the latest media onslaught, Mr. Jibrin said the fraudulent tendencies of Speaker Dogara and some other House principal officers had become so pervasive that President Buhari would not hesitate to isolate and investigate them if he were to be briefed about them.

Meanwhile, despite the growing demand from several quarters for the National Assembly to open its legislative proceedings and financial transactions to the citizenry for them to unravel the circumstances under which all these scandals were perpetrated, Speaker Dogara has maintained silence, saying he would rather allow the House to deal with the matter as an institution instead of engaging in political mudslinging with Mr. Jibrin.

It will be recalled that Mr. Jibrin was at the centre of allegations by House members during the 2016 budget exercise when it was alleged that the N60 billion earmarked for the Calabar–Lagos rail project was diverted to other projects leading to calls for his sack.
