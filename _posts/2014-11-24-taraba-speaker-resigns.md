The Speaker of Taraba House of Assembly, Mr Josiah Kente has resigned his position.

He told journalists on Monday in Jalingo that he had forwarded his resignation letter to the Clerk of the assembly, stating that the decision was for personal reasons and in the interest of peace in the state.

"I write to tender my resignation as the Speaker of the Taraba State House of Assembly, Jalingo from today, 24th day of November, 2014. My resignation is personal. I want to seek this opportunity to thank members of the 7th Assembly for giving me the opportunity to serve as Hon. Speaker for the past one year. I pledge to remain loyal and would always contribute my best to the well-being of the Hon House", he stated.
