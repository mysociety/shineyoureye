Ahead of the September 10, 2016 governorship election in Edo State, the Markafi-led Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) faction has picked a former local government chairman (Esan North East), Hon. John Yakubu, as running mate to its governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.

It will be recalled that the PDP had earlier zoned the position of the running mate of its governorship candidate to the Edo Central senatorial district.

Media reports confirmed that the governorship candidate of the party, Pastor Ize-Iyamu; Edo State chairman of the PDP, Dan Orbih and leaders of the party across the three senatorial districts of the state were also at the meeting where the decision was taken over the weekend in Benin at the residence of a former Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP, Chief Tony Anenih.

It was also gathered that a consensus agreement was reached to pick Yakubu as running mate as majority of the leaders of the party endorsed his candidacy.

Meanwhile, Ali Modu Sheriff faction of the PDP has vowed to submit the name of Matthew Iduoriyekwemwen to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as PDP candidate for Edo governorship election.

It is however hoped that the festering leadership crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that has polarized the party between Senator Ahmed Makarfi and Senator Ali Modu Sheriff would suffice to make the party pass through it pains and troubles and make a viable alternative to the incumbent All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State.
