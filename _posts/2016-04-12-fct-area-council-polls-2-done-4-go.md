The FCT Area Council poll was logically expected in some quarters to entail a low turnout of voters. The reason was because just about 55% of 1 million registered voters picked up their PVCs. This expectation was well proven on the day, as far from many voters participated in the electoral process.

Following the exercise on Saturday, the INEC declared results for only 2 of 6 local council areas – Bwari and Kwali. APC's Joseph Shazin was declared winner of the polls in Kwali, while APC’s Musa Dikko emerged victorious in Bwari.

On the other hand, as a result of perceived occurrences of violence and nonuse of smart cards, elections were declared inconclusive in 4 area councils – Abaji, Gwagwalada, Kuje and Municipal. According to INEC, the decision was based on the fact that the number of cancelled votes was more than the votes separating the leading candidates.

The Independent National electoral Commission has scheduled a rerun to take place in 39 polling units, spread across the 4 council areas in question.

The new election date is April 13 (tomorrow).

Accreditation and voting processes are set to kick-start simultaneously at 8am.
