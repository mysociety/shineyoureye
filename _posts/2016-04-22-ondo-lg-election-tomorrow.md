After 7 years of running the Ondo State Government, the Governor Mimiko-led administration will conduct its first election for aspiring local government chairmen. The exercise billed for **April 23 (tomorrow)** happens to be just about 7 months before the end of the governor's tenure.

In response, at least 2 major political parties have opted to boycott the election - the All progressives Congress (APC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The aggrieved parties plan to direct all their efforts towards the battle for the gubernatorial seat later in November this year.

Never the less, the importance of this electoral exercise cannot be overemphasized. It is another opportunity for the locals to reactivate their citizenship. This is a process that will determine who leads each of the 18 local government areas for the next 4 years. In essence, public funds will be committed to this 18 men and/or women. These 18 beings will decide the mode and level of development and progress of each local government area for the 4 years. This is greatly important.

To ensure that the exercise turns out a success, the Ondo State Commissioner of Police (Hilda Ibifuro-Harrisson) has deployed over **6000 Police officers** to ensure order in each local government area. This is in addition to the **7000 ad-hoc staff** already trained by the Ondo State Independent Electoral Commission.

All is set. Kick-off is less than 24 hours. Residents in Ondo's 18 LGAs have the **priviledge to choose from 17 political parties**. This is a decision they must make themselves. May the people win!
