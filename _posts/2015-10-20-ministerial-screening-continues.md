It's another plenary day!

All eyes are on the Senate, as the ministerial Screening is to continue today.

As a build up to the process, the National Prayer, a much needed exercise, was well said:

ALMIGHTY GOD, Ruler of Heaven and Earth, we beseech Thee to inpire and guide all our counsels and actions, so that we may always walk in the path of justice, love and charity to one another,

Help us with Thy Grace to do only those things that will promote the unity, happiness and prosperity of Nigeria.

						Amen.

Citizens can also participate in the questioning process by using the hashtags -
