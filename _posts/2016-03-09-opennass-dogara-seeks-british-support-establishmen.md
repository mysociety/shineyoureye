Speaker, House of Representatives, Mr. Yakubu Dogara, has solicited the support of the British parliament in establishing Radio and Television stations for the National Assembly.

Dogara noted that the establishment of the media outfits in the parliament would enable Nigerians to access and assess activities of their elected representatives as the stations, when established, will transmit proceedings live from the two chambers.

The Speaker said the media stations were in line with the legislative agenda of the 8th National Assembly and its commitment to encourage citizen participation in governance.

Dogara who said these when he received members of the International Development Committee of United Kingdomâ€™s Parliament in his office on last week Thursday, also disclosed that the House of Reps had set up the Nigeria-British Parliamentary Friendship Group as part of measures  to strengthen the relationship between the two parliaments.

The Speaker also told the UK Lawmakers that the House of Representatives had begun the process of amending over 130 laws of the country to meet the contemporary realities of governance with the support of the Department For International Development (DFID).
