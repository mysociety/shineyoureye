The Nigerian Senate on Tuesday, 15th of March, 2016 voted against the Gender and Equal Opportunity (GEO) Bill. The bill could not pass the second reading after the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, put the bill to vote with the “Nays” having it.

The GEO Bill seeks adoption of special temporary measures to eliminate discrimination and ensure equal opportunities for majority of Nigerians, while it also seeks appropriate measures against gender discrimination in political and public life and prohibitions of violence to women.

Although, there have been controversies about the GEO Bill and the recent decision by the federal lawmakers have just sparked up another social media outcry as it will limit the female gender.

The questions on the lips of many Nigerians - How can one explain to people that our lawmakers shut down Gender and Equality Bill using ‘Aye’ and ‘Nay’ votes only? What happened to electronic voting in the 21st Century?

No doubt, this could easily affect the fundamental human right in the country and might dent the chances to prevent violence against women leading to more cases like Ese Orurus’.
