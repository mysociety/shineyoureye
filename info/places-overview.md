Nigeria is divided into 36 [States](http://www.shineyoureye.org/place/is/state/ "States of Nigeria") and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.

Each State has 3 [Senatorial Districts](http://www.shineyoureye.org/position/senator/ "Senatorial Districts") and FCT has only 1 district, which is why we have 109 Senators.

There are 360 [Federal Constituencies](http://www.shineyoureye.org/position/representative/ "Federal Constituencies") which are a function of state size and population, thus the number of federal constituencies vary from state to state.
